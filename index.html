            <h3 class="Lb_heading">Doreamon</h3>
          
      <p>Doraemon (Japanese: ドラえもん) is a fictional character in the Japanese manga and 
        anime series of the same name created by Fujiko F. Fujio. Doraemon is a male robotic
         earless cat that travels back in time from the 22nd century to aid a preteen boy named 
         Nobita. An official birth certificate for the character gives him a birth date of 3
         September 2112 and lists his city of residency as Kawasaki, Kanagawa, the city where 
         the manga was created.[6] In 2008, Japan's Foreign Ministry appointed Doraemon the country's 
         "anime ambassador"</p>

            <p>Nobita Nobi (野比 のび太, Nobi Nobita) is the co-protagonist of the series. He wears
             glasses, a red or yellow polo shirt with a white collar, and blue or black shorts and 
             white socks and light blue shoes. Although he's not good at sports, he's good at shooting
             and has been reflected in the movies many time. He's also good at string figure which sometime
             considered a girls' game. Son of Tamako and Nobisuke Nobi. Future father of Nobisuke (his son).
             Future husband or boyfriend of Shizuka and great-great-grandfather of Sewashi</p>

             <h3 class="Lb_heading">Shizuka</h3>
             <p>Shizuka Minamoto (源 静香, Minamoto Shizuka), nicknamed Shizuka-chan (しずかちゃん) is a 
             smart, kind and pretty girl. She is often represented by the colour pink, and is seen wearing
             a pink shirt and skirt. The word 'Shizuka (しずか)' means 'Quiet'. She is Nobita's best friend 
            and love-interest. She does not shun Nobita due to his failing grades, lazy disposition or constant 
            failures. In fact, she often tries to encourage him to do better, though she usually fails to convince
            him. Shizuka likes to bathe several times a day; however, a running gag in the series is that she is 
            sometimes interrupted by a sudden appearance of Nobita (sometimes Doraemon, Gian, or Suneo) usually
            due to misuse of Doraemon's gadgets like the Anywhere Door (Doko Demo Doa in Japanese).</p>

            <h3 class="Lb_heading">Gian</h3>
            <p>Takeshi Goda (剛田 武, Gōda Takeshi) usually known by the nickname "Gian" (「ジャイアン」, 
            "Jaian", English: Big G) is a strong and quick-tempered local bully. He frequently steals 
             other children's stuff (especially Nobita's and Suneo's) under the pretext of "borrowing" them,
             unless the toy is damaged. He is known for his awful singing voice, though he considers himself
             a great singer. To prove this, Gian sometimes "invites" others to attend his concerts, under the
            threat of beatings. His singing is so horrible that it causes nausea in listeners; once when Nobita
            and Doraemon try to mute it in a silent world, Gian's writing of the lyrics on a board have the same
            nausea-causing effect.</p>

            <h3 class="Lb_heading">Suneo</h3>
            <P>Suneo Honekawa (骨川 スネ夫, Honekawa Suneo) is the fox-faced (inherited from his mother) rich
             child who loves to flaunt his material wealth before everyone, especially Nobita. A lot of the 
             stories start with Suneo showing off some new video game, toy or pet which evokes Nobita's envy.
             He is often seen with Gian, teasing Nobita. He also often pushes Nobita aside with silly excuses 
             while he invites Gian and Shizuka to his parties or resorts. However, he is actually one of Nobita's 
             closest friends, who would often ask for his and Doraemon's help. In the films, Suneo is often the 
             one most reluctant to take part in Nobita and Doraemon's adventures, and he also tries to face as 
             little trouble as possible and go home, unless others convince him, making him somewhat a coward.</P>
